dupes
=====

Small perl script to detect duplicates files on a directory tree.

It count the number of file on each directory where file are located.

And suggest you to remove all the duplicates files contain in the biggest directory.

I have use it to remove duplicate jpg after backuping my flickr account with flickrbackup.py (in pip)
